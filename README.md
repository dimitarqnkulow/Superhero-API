Team Player Attitude:
In any case I would cooperate with a colleague, no matter his level, as we say in Bulgaria "two brains are more than one". I'll share my idea and then I'll dry the idea of the opposite or vice versa for the purpose of constructive conversation to build the best we can. Once we've come to a solution and have a structure in place, I'd like us to divide up our tasks and after each task is completed, have each do a code review of the other and signal possible improvements. I love working this way. :)

Eagerness to Learn: I would make a base no matter if it's relational or non-relational, I would use FireBase or MongoDB as I have done in projects you can see in my GitHub repos, I have whole projects with back-end and front-end. I'd add users as well as pages to show when you're logged in and when you're not.

Steps to get started:

1. Use npm init -y in the console;
2. To start the server, type npm install in the console;
3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and have fun;

Run tests:

1. Use npm init -y in the console(if you haven't done it yet otherwise skip);
2. To start the server, type npm install in the console(if you haven't done it yet otherwise skip);
3. Use npm test and see if the tests pass;
